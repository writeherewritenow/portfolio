# About Me

With over 15 years of experience in technical communication, I possess the key elements that make for an effective technical writer—clear writing, technical aptitude, design thinking, service mindset, and project management skills. I find the task of organizing information and creating structures rewarding. I’m able to take large, tangled information collections and transform them into highly useful and usable structures, all while exercising the art of brevity. 

Moreover, my early career experiences allow me to see situations and requirements from the perspective of different stakeholders. For example, as a former commercial apprentice, I am sensitive to the concerns of top-level management and other stakeholders who monitor returns on investments. Having worked as a technical marketing writer, I understand how product features are usually presented to prospective customers and how expectations of perceived benefits affect the overall user experience. Throughout my career, I have been a staunch advocate for clear and consistent writing that enables product users to easily grasp complex concepts, navigate products with confidence, and accomplish tasks seamlessly.
